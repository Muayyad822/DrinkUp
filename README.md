# DrinkUp 💧

DrinkUp is a personalized hydration tracking web application that I built specially for my friend, Teniola. While many water tracking apps exist, this one is uniquely customized with personal touches, motivational messages, and features tailored to her preferences and needs.

## The Story Behind DrinkUp 💝

I created DrinkUp as a gift for my friend Teniola to help her maintain healthy hydration habits.

The app includes personalized greetings, custom-written daily tips, and achievement messages specifically crafted for her.
